// manifest.json is the source of truth for what a release IS: one entry per
// component naming its version and where its bits live. Uploaded as an asset on
// every release, and read by (a) the next release's `plan` to decide carry vs
// build, (b) humans. Pure — unit-tested in .github/scripts/tests/manifest.test.js.
//
// Carry-forward model: a release version is an UMBRELLA. A rebuilt component
// takes the new version; a CARRIED component keeps its own older version and the
// release just references it.
//   - Images: nothing to do on carry. The component's version tag and :latest
//     already exist in the registry from when it was built; the manifest simply
//     references that older tag (ghcr...:0.1.4 on a v0.1.9 release). We never
//     retag a carried image to the new version — :0.1.9 pointing at 0.1.4 bits
//     is the same lie as renaming a carried asset.
//   - Assets: physically copied onto the new release under their ORIGINAL name
//     (tenir-even-v0.1.4.ehpk on the v0.1.9 release), so every release page is
//     self-contained. Renaming to the new version would make a file whose
//     in-package version (app.json / versionCode) contradicts its name — which
//     Even Hub and Android act on.
